# Elden Ring Chaos Mod
Elden Ring Chaos Mod introduces an element of unpredictability to your gameplay. Drawing inspiration from chaos mods in other games, this modification introduces random effects every 30 seconds. These effects range from simple attribute changes to transforming every enemy into Malenia(in future...) there is about 25 effects for now, but the quantity will grow
