# Elden Ring Chaos Mod
Replica of GTA 5 Chaos mod for Elden Ring. Create a random effect every 30 seconds. These effects range from simple attribute changes to transforming every enemy into Malenia(in future...). Currently, there are about 25 effects, but the quantity will grow.

## Installation
- Download the latest release of Elden Ring Chaos Mod from the Releases section.
- Extract the contents of the downloaded archive to a folder of your choice(.exe and resources must be in 1 folder).
- Put the .bat file to game folder(../steamapps/common/ELDEN RING/Game) and run it whenever you want to start the game without EasyAntiCheat (if you run game without .bat you will be in online, and ***YOU CAN BE BANNED***)
- Run the Elden Chaos Mod executable to inject chaos into your ELDEN RING gameplay.

## Help
- You need to start the game first, and only then press the start button in the mod.
- You wouldn't see the overlay if the game isn't in borderless window mode.
